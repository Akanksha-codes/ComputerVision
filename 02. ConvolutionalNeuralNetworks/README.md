# **Computer Vision: Convolutional Neural Networks**

The [**Convolutions**](https://github.com/ThinamXx/ComputerVision/blob/main/02.%20ConvolutionalNeuralNetworks/Convolutions.ipynb) notebook contains all the dependencies required to understand the implementation of Image Convolutions and Kernels. 

The [**Convolutional Layers**](https://github.com/ThinamXx/ComputerVision/blob/main/02.%20ConvolutionalNeuralNetworks/Convolutional%20Layers.ipynb) notebook contains all the dependencies required to understand Keras Conv2D Class and Convolutional Layers.
