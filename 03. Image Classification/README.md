# **Computer Vision: Image Classification**

The [**Simplepreprocessor**](https://github.com/ThinamXx/ComputerVision/blob/main/03.%20Image%20Classification/Simplepreprocessor.ipynb) notebook contains implementation of simple image preprocessor, loading an image dataset into memory, and K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier. K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier doesnâ€™t actually learn anything, but it directly relies on the distance between feature vectors.

**Simple Preprocessor and Dataset Loader**
- I will build an image preprocessor that resizes the image, ignoring the aspect ratio. I have presented the implementation of Image Preprocessor and Dataset Loader here in the snapshot.

**K-Nearest Neighbor**
- K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier doesnâ€™t actually learn anything, but it directly relies on the distance between feature vectors. I have presented the implementation of K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier and Model Evaluation here in the snapshot.
