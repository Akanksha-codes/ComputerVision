# **COMPUTER VISION**

The repository contains a list of projects and notebooks which I have worked on while reading Computer Vision, Deep Learning and OpenCV from [**PyImageSearch**](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/). 

### ðŸ“š**NOTEBOOKS:**

[**1. OPEN CV**](https://github.com/ThinamXx/ComputerVision/tree/main/01.%20OpenCV)
- The **OpenCV** notebook contains the basics of OpenCV such as Loading an Image, Resizing Images, Rotating Image, Edge Detection, Thresholding, Drawing and Masking, Contour and Shape Detection. The **OCV Project I** notebook contains the implementation of Rotating Images correctly without cut off. The OCV Project II notebook contains the implementation of Color Detection and Histogram Matching on images.

[**2. CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS**](https://github.com/ThinamXx/ComputerVision/tree/main/02.%20ConvolutionalNeuralNetworks)
- The **Convolutions** notebook contains all the dependencies required to understand the implementation of Image Convolutions and Kernels. The **Convolutional Layers** notebook contains all the dependencies required to understand Keras Conv2D Class and Convolutional Layers.

[**3. IMAGE CLASSIFICATION**](https://github.com/ThinamXx/ComputerVision/tree/main/03.%20Image%20Classification)
- The **Simplepreprocessor** notebook contains implementation of simple image preprocessor, loading an image dataset into memory, and K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier. K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier doesnâ€™t actually learn anything, but it directly relies on the distance between feature vectors. The **GradientDescent** notebook contains implementation of Gradient Descent Algorithms. The **StochasticGradientDescent** notebook contains implementation of Stochastic Gradient Descent, Image Classification and Regularization.

[**4. NEURAL NETWORKS**](https://github.com/ThinamXx/ComputerVision/tree/main/04.%20Neural%20Networks)
- The **Neural Networks** notebook contains the implementation of Perceptron algorithm, backpropagation algorithm, and neural networks from scratch.

[**5. LENET ARCHITECTURE**](https://github.com/ThinamXx/ComputerVision/tree/main/05.%20LeNet%20Architecture)
- The **LeNet Architecture** notebook contains the implementation of LeNet Architecture. LeNet is a seminal work in the deep learning literature which demonstrates how neural networks could be trained to recognize objects in images without feture extraction.

[**6. VGGNET ARCHITECTURE**](https://github.com/ThinamXx/ComputerVision/tree/main/06.%20VGGNet%20Architecture) 
- The **Mini VGGNet** notebook contains the implementation of VGGNet Architecture. It makes the use of only 3 X 3 filters regardless of network depth.
