# **COMPUTER VISION**

The repository contains a list of projects and notebooks which I have worked on while reading Computer Vision, Deep Learning and OpenCV from [**PyImageSearch**](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/). 

### ðŸ“š**NOTEBOOKS:**

[**1. OPEN CV**](https://github.com/ThinamXx/ComputerVision/tree/main/01.%20OpenCV)
- The **OpenCV** notebook contains the basics of OpenCV such as Loading an Image, Resizing Images, Rotating Image, Edge Detection, Thresholding, Drawing and Masking, Contour and Shape Detection. The **OCV Project I** notebook contains the implementation of Rotating Images correctly without cut off.
