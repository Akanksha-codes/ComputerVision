# **Computer Vision: OpenCV**

The [**OpenCV**](https://github.com/ThinamXx/ComputerVision/blob/main/01.%20OpenCV/OpenCV.ipynb) notebook contains the basics of **OpenCV** such as Loading an Image, Resizing Images, Rotating Image, Edge Detection, Thresholding, Drawing and Masking, Contour and Shape Detection. 

The [**OCV Project I**](https://github.com/ThinamXx/ComputerVision/blob/main/01.%20OpenCV/OCV%20Project%20I.ipynb) notebook contains the implementation of Rotating Images correctly without cut off.

**Image Processing**
- I have presented the implementation of OpenCV in Resizing and Rotating and Image, Smoothing and Drawing on an Image, Converting Image to Grayscale, Edge Detection, Thresholding, Detecting and Drawing Contours, Erosions and Dilations here in the snapshot.
