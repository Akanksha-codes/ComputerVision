# **Computer Vision: OpenCV**

The [**OpenCV**](https://github.com/ThinamXx/ComputerVision/blob/main/01.%20OpenCV/OpenCV.ipynb) notebook contains the basics of **OpenCV** such as Loading an Image, Resizing Images, Rotating Image, Edge Detection, Thresholding, Drawing and Masking, Contour and Shape Detection. 

The [**OCV Project I**](https://github.com/ThinamXx/ComputerVision/blob/main/01.%20OpenCV/OCV%20Project%20I.ipynb) notebook contains the implementation of Rotating Images correctly without cut off. 

The [**OCV Project II**](https://github.com/ThinamXx/ComputerVision/blob/main/01.%20OpenCV/OCV%20Project%20II.ipynb) notebook contains the implementation of Color Detection and Histogram Matching on images.

**Image Processing**
- I have presented the implementation of OpenCV in Resizing and Rotating and Image, Smoothing and Drawing on an Image, Converting Image to Grayscale, Edge Detection, Thresholding, Detecting and Drawing Contours, Erosions and Dilations here in the snapshot.

**Rotating Image**
- I have presented the implementation of OpenCV in Rotating Images and Getting ROI of Images here in the snapshot.

**Histogram Matching**
- Histogram Matching can be used as a normalization technique in an image processing pipeline as a form of color correction and color matching which allows to obtain a consistent, normalized representation of images even if lighting conditions change. I have presented the implementation of OpenCV in Histogram Matching here in the snapshot.
