# **Computer Vision: LeNet Architecture**

The [**LeNet Architecture**](https://github.com/ThinamXx/ComputerVision/blob/main/05.%20LeNet%20Architecture/LeNet.ipynb) notebook contains the implementation of LeNet Architecture. LeNet is a seminal work in the deep learning literature which demonstrates how neural networks could be trained to recognize objects in images without feture extraction.

**LeNet**
- I will define the build method of LeNet architecture below. It requires four parameters: width of input image, height of input image, depth of image, number of class labels in the classification task. The Sequential class, the building block of sequential networks sequentially stack one layer on top of the other layer initialized below. I have presented the implementation of LeNet Architecture, Training and Model Evaluation here in the snapshot.
